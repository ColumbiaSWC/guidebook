# Curriculum Notes

## Alan Croswell's notes on the Software Carpentry curriculum


### Unix Shell

- Man pages missing from git-bash on windows. Fix with `google man ls`
- Macos `ls --help` doesn’t work (it’s too BSDish to have the --help switch)
- `sort -n lengths.txt` gives the same result without `-n` because wc’s output is left-padded and spaces collate differently on MacOS vs. Linux. See #810. LANG=C vs. LANG=en_US.UTF8. A better example would use left-aligned numbers.
Tab completion doesn’t appear to work in git bash on Windows
Python
Use of jupyter lab vs. notebook – doesn’t really matter but since the syllabus uses Lab, we should too.
Someone asked about web scraping, which isn’t covered in this lesson. There’s is a LC lesson on web scraping with Python and the use of Xpath, which may be a good more advanced workshop to run during the semester.
There was one case I noticed in the Beta Python lesson that the exercises referenced datasets that were not included in the setup data, which made it non-useful.
Non-US Keyboard
French Mac has no ~ (googled: use option-N but that doesn’t work on US keyboard). In SWC slack the answer was these keys are on option-numbers. Certainly not the case on my US keyboard…. Added this int'l keyboard info to the workshops wiki.
international students don’t always know the names for single vs. double quotes, tilde, etc.
Git
git lesson setup page doesn’t say to create a github.com account; only in the git download instructions. Might be better to say it here as well.
We didn’t get to collaboration via github PR’s, merges, etc. due to poor time management. We need to stick to the syllabus and limit the digressions.
Windows users get a GUI GitHub login prompt when trying to do a git push to a remote, rather than being prompted on the terminal
One student confused the ! in the GitHub welcome email as part of their username, which caused git bash to freak out with a broken pipe error when they tried to push to Github. Worth noting in case anyone else has this issue.
LaTeX
Out of the entire class, only one student uses LaTeX to write her papers and was lamenting how her colleagues waste a lot of time trying to center figures in Word, etc. Should we offer a LaTeX workshop? Does somebody already? Did you know you can export a Jupyter notebook as LaTex? And, of course, matplotlib and R can export figures in any number of vector formats (svg, eps, etc.) that render nicely with TeX.
She uses https://www.overleaf.com but apps like TeXShop are pretty nice and fit the “run it all on your laptop” mode
