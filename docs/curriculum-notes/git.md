# Curriculum Notes: Git

## Alan Croswell's notes on the Software Carpentry curriculum

- git lesson setup page doesn't say to create a github.com
        account; only in the git download instructions. Might be
        better to say it here as well.

- We didn't get to collaboration via github PR's, merges, etc. due
        to poor time management. We need to stick to the syllabus and
        limit the digressions. *Note from Patrick: kind of feel like it's fine to not get to everything. Better they understand what you cover, in my opinion.*

- Windows users get a GUI GitHub login prompt when trying to do a
        git push to a remote, rather than being prompted on the
        terminal

- One student confused the `!` in the GitHub welcome email as part
        of their username, which caused git bash to freak out with a
        broken pipe error when they tried to push to Github. Worth
        noting in case anyone else has this issue.
