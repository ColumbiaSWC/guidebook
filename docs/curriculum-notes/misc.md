# Curriculum Notes: Miscellaneous

## Alan Croswell's notes on the Software Carpentry curriculum

### Non-US Keyboard

- French Mac has no \~ (googled: use option-N but that doesn't
        > work on US keyboard). In SWC slack the answer was these keys
        > are on option-numbers. Certainly not the case on my US
        > keyboard.... Added [*this int\'l keyboard info to the
        > workshops
        > wiki*](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions#international-keyboards).

- international students don't always know the names for single
        > vs. double quotes, tilde, etc.

### LaTeX

- Out of the entire class, only one student uses LaTeX to write
        > her papers and was lamenting how her colleagues waste a lot of
        > time trying to center figures in Word, etc. **Should we offer
        > a LaTeX workshop?** Does somebody already? Did you know you
        > can export a Jupyter notebook as LaTex? And, of course,
        > matplotlib and R can export figures in any number of vector formats (svg, eps, etc.) that render nicely with TeX. She uses [*https://www.overleaf.com*](https://www.overleaf.com/) but apps like TeXShop are pretty nice and fit the "run it all on your laptop" model.
