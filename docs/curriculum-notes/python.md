# Curriculum Notes: Python

## Alan Croswell's notes on the Software Carpentry curriculum

- Use of jupyter lab vs. notebook -- doesn't really matter but
        > since the syllabus uses Lab, we should too.
- Someone asked about web scraping, which isn't covered in this
        > lesson. There's is a LC lesson on web scraping with Python and
        > the use of Xpath, which may be a good more advanced workshop
        > to run during the semester.

- There was one case I noticed in the Beta Python lesson that the
        > exercises referenced datasets that were not included in the
        > setup data, which made it non-useful.
