# Information for Helpers

## What is a helper?

At Foundations for Research Computing workshops, intensives, and bootcamps, a helper or helpers will circulate in the room to resolve technical issues and answer questions from students. The helper has a critical role in making sure training events go smoothly, as the instructor will typically have limited time and attention for individual students while teaching.

## What do I need to be a helper?

Being a helper


We'll be starting at 9:00 at Butler Library, the large white building at the center of the south end of the Morningside campus. We'll have a table set up just inside the entrance. Please introduce yourself to me as a helper so that I'll know you're present and I will provide directions to your room. Lunch will be provided, and we have a vegetarian/vegan option. The day will end at 4:30.

You can find directions to Butler here:

The only preparation we ask helpers for is to familiarize yourself with the lessons. You do not need to be deeply familiar or expert in these areas, and really a willingness to jump in and help students is the most important element.

Please check at the end of this email whether you have been assigned to Python or Râ€”you need not prepare both. Here are links to the lessons:

The Unix Shell
Version Control with Git
Plotting and Programming in Python
Programming with R

Software Carpentry instructors use a "flag" system to allow students to request help or show that they have completed a task. Students are given red and green sticky notes, and putting a red sticky on the computer shows that a student requires help. Green sticky notes show when students are finished with a task. So on Thursday and Friday, keep an eye out for those red stickies!

Please let me know if you have questions about the lessons, logistics, or anything else. I am copying the lead instructors for each session in case they have anything to add or wish to reach out. Thanks again, and looking forward to seeing you all in action on Thursday!
